      <h1>Why HydraDX</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="box main">
      In the old financial world, liquidity is fragmented among many
      gatekeepers, protecting their business interests, profiting from the
      upside, while socializing the downside. The cost of liquidity is also high
      because legacy technology consists of siloed databases.
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      Blockchain is changing this unfortunate reality by providing an open and
      universally accessible technology layer for transaction settlement and
      asset exchange.<br /><br />
      However, the dominant blockchain application platform – Ethereum – suffers
      from being a general platform for many varied use cases – the network is
      getting clogged and fees are high.
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      In order to achieve the optimal properties, HydraDX is built as a
      parachain – specialized blockchain in the Polkadot network. It is
      benefiting from shared security, speed and flexibility of the Substrate
      framework while remaining optimized for a single purpose: enabling fluid
      programmable value exchange.<br />Thanks to planned interoperability
      between Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems, Hydra will tap into Ethereum’s
      liquidity, talent and community, merging the best of the both worlds. 
